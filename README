Messagee is a sample android app that acts as a Apache Usergrid client.

The Usergrid homepage is:
http://usergrid.incubator.apache.org/

source code is:
https://github.com/apache/incubator-usergrid

Apigee once write a sample of Usergrid android sdk client, 
since it was written 3 years ago, and cann't run on the newest
Apache Usergrid sdk.

I make a fork from 
https://github.com/apigee/usergrid-sample-android-messagee
to
https://github.com/ablozhou/usergrid-sample-android-messagee

Thanks to apigee.

1. Change to newest usergrid sdk.

2. Add messagee to ADT eclipse project.

3. Change to newest library of fastxml.

I also create an ADT eclipse project of newest UserGrid Android SDK.
